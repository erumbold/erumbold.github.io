            <div>

                    I have sent out a survey form to different groups of people for the subjective component of my project, and I have already received several responses. Although I don't expect to get enough responses to have statistical significance, I still believe it'll be enough to make general observations about what users may be looking for in a music streaming service. The survey can be found here (<a href="https://forms.gle/uJZGUikM5KXQHcZj8">https://forms.gle/uJZGUikM5KXQHcZj8</a>) and will remain open to responses until I need to analyze the data - most likely the week before the Demo is due.

                <p>
                    For the data logging component, I've decided to work in Python since it's my most proficient language. I found a tutorial (<a href="https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-network-usage-monitor-in-python">https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-network-usage-monitor-in-python</a>) that demonstrates how to make a network traffic monitor per process using the <tt>psutil</tt> and <tt>Scapy</tt> libraries. Between this update and next, I plan to adapt the tutorial code to log the traffic from each service's desktop app while streaming music. Note: YouTube Music currently does not have a native desktop app available, so I will be logging traffic from my web browser instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the streaming services don't all have desktop apps, they do all have iOS apps. I'm unsure how I'd be able to monitor the traffic from my phone at the moment, but I'll spend some time this week to find a possible solution. Ideally, I'd like to do these experiments on both a computer and a phone since people most often listen to music on their phones, moreso than on their computers. If I can't find a suitable method by next update, I'll focus on just the desktop experiments.
