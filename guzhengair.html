  <h3>What is the <i>GuzhengAir</i></h3>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <p>As the name suggests, the <i>GuzhengAir</i> is an electronic instrument designed to simulate the playstyle and unique sound of a traditional Chinese guzheng. To play the <i>GuzhengAir</i>, place a hand or finger (typically the thumb) in front of the main ultrasonic sensor. Then, when the finger is lifted, resembling the motion of plucking a string, a sample of a guzheng note is played.</p>
        <p>The instrument is tuned to the G major pentatonic scale, range D4-D5; and the pitch of the sample is shifted according to the finger's proximity to the sensor before "plucking"- lower notes are played closer to the sensor, whereas higher notes are played closer to the player.</p>

  <h3>Why make the <i>GuzhengAir</i></h3>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <p>When figuring out what instrument I wanted to create, I considered many ideas. I was inspired by existing gestural instruments, so I decided to create an instrument with its own unique gesture. I set my mind on a plucking motion and realized I could reimagine the guzheng.</p>
        <p>Throughout my life, I have pursued many ways of connecting with my Chinese heritage; part of this was discovering a love of traditional Chinese instruments and music. In my life, I have learned many instruments, of both Western and Eastern origin, and I would have loved to learn the guzheng. But there are a number of reasons why I was less successful with the guzheng than other instruments:
          <ul>
            <li>Guzheng technique is significantly right-hand dominant; I'm left-handed.</li>
            <li>The guzheng is not easily portable; they are just over 5 feet in length and weigh between 20 and 30 pounds.</li>
            <li>Guzhengs, like many instruments, are expensive; they range from a few hundred dollars to a couple thousand, not including strings, picks, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          In addition to my desire to create a unique gesture, I aim to solve these issues with my design of the <i>GuzhengAir</i>.

  <h3>My Process</h3>
    <p>My first step was to make pitch shifts over a continuous sine wave using the two ultrasonic sensors, not dissimilar to a theremin. The main sensor, which faces the player, is used to determine pitch; the playable pitches were limited to the G major pentatonic scale. The secondary sensor, which faces upward, bends the pitch determined from the main sensor up to 100 cents. This is to mimic the other half of a traditional guzheng, which is used to play bends and vibrato.</p>
    <p>After figuring out the pitch shift mechanics, I replaced the sine wave with an audio sample of a guzheng playing D4. I looped the sample for simplicity at the time. In this step, I realized that the overtones of the original note (D4) were also being shifted, and therefore becoming distorted. A simple low-pass filter was effective enough to solve this issue.</p>
    <p>The next issue to tackle was the looping. The motivation of this instrument was the unique play gesture, which at this stage of development was not being used. Adding a both a <i>select</i> object and a <i>onebang</i> object to the Max patch made it so the guzheng sample would only play once when my hand moved out of the main ultrasonic sensor's range.</p>

  <p>Arduino code and the Max Patcher for the <i>GuzhengAir</i> can be found in <a href="https://github.com/erumbold/GuzhengAir">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      As I continue to work on the <i>GuzhengAir</i>, I have many additions and improvements that I want to implement:
      <ol>
        <li>Exchange the guzheng sample for a generated signal that resembles a guzheng. This should make the pitch shifting easier and sound more realistic, especially for the higher pitches played on the current model that often get distorted.</li>
        <li>Add capabilities to play trills and glissandos - techniques and sounds that are characteristic of the guzheng.</li>
        <li>Add the ability to play multiple pitches at once.</li>
        <li>Add octave-switching functionality. (The guzheng typically spans 4 octaves, whereas the <i>GuzhengAir</i> currently covers one)
      </ol>
      I will continue to update this page as this project develops.
